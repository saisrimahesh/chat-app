Real-Time Chat Application
This is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and React. The application allows users to send and receive messages instantly, with all connected users able to see new messages in real-time.

Features
Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly, with the chat automatically updating for all connected users.

User Connection Tracking: The server tracks users through unique socket IDs and logs when users connect or disconnect.

Message Broadcasting: Messages sent by a user are broadcasted to all other connected users.

Frontend Built with React: The user interface is responsive and interactive, providing a seamless chat experience.


Technologies Used

Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
Socket.IO (for real-time WebSocket connections)

Frontend:
React.js
Socket.IO client

Project Structure
bash

│   ├── index.js       # Backend server setup using Express and Socket.IO

How It Works
Connection: When a user visits the frontend, they are connected to the backend via WebSocket (managed by Socket.IO). Each user is assigned a unique socket ID.
Sending Messages: When a user sends a message, it is emitted from the frontend to the backend server via a send-message event.
Broadcasting Messages: The server receives the message and broadcasts it to all connected users using the received-message event.
Disconnection: When a user disconnects, the server logs the disconnection and keeps track of the connected users.
